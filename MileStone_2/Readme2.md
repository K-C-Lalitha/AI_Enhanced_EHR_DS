# Module 2: Medical Imaging Enhancement using GenAI

## Objective
Enhance medical image quality using **Generative AI (GenAI)** to support better diagnosis and visualization.

---

## Tasks
- Apply **ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network)** for medical image enhancement.  
- Improve **resolution and clarity** of MRI images.  
- Evaluate enhancement quality using **PSNR** and **SSIM** metrics.  
- Provide **visual comparisons** of original vs enhanced images.

---

## Model Used
- **Model:** ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution GAN)  
- **Purpose:** Generate high-resolution and clear images from low-quality MRI slices.  
- **Input:** MRI images (grayscale or color)  
- **Output:** Enhanced MRI images with improved clarity and detail

## Results

| Metric | Before Enhancement | After ESRGAN Enhancement |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **PSNR (dB)** | 20–25 | **30–40** |
| **SSIM** | 0.6–0.7 | **0.9+** |

---

## Visual Comparison
Three MRI slice samples were selected to demonstrate:
- Original (Low-resolution)
- Enhanced (ESRGAN output)

---

## Conclusion
The **ESRGAN model** effectively enhanced medical images by improving resolution and preserving anatomical details, enabling clearer clinical visualization and supporting diagnosis accuracy.
